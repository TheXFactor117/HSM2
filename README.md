## License and Legal Information
Loot Slash Conquer does not have a specific license and is therefore copyright of TheXFactor117. Below is a list of common things you can and cannot do with the mod and its code/assets.

* You MAY NOT take large portions of the mod's code and/or assets and create an entirely new project under your own name.
* You MAY NOT host download files personally on any website. The only download links to the mods files should be on the OFFICIAL CurseForge project.
* You MAY NOT compile and build the project's source code and publicly release the resulting file.
  * However, you MAY compile and build the project's source code for private use (this does not mean public modpacks).
* You MAY take portions of the mod's code to help implement certain features within your own mod.
* You MAY NOT use any of the assets bundled with the mod for any reason, including artwork, models, sounds, structures, or other forms of assets.
* You MAY use this mod in modpacks so long as you provide a link back to the GITHUB REPOSITORY and give credit where necessary.
* You MAY compile the source code and help contribute your own code/assets to the project.
* If this project is ever abandoned and you wish to take over the mod (code, assets, name, and everything else associated with it), you MAY do so if you have written permission from myself. If I have not been active on GitHub, Discord, MCF, or CurseForge for a significant amount of time and therefore cannot get in touch with me, you may take over the mod.

TLDR: Be smart. You can use this in modpacks with appropriate credit, you can use the mod's source code as a reference for your own projects, but you cannot directly copy large portions of the mod's code and release it as your own.
